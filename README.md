# Hello there! My name is Waylon ðŸ‘‹
I am a Full Stack Web Developer who is currently enrolled in Bloom Institute of Technology's(BIT) Full Stack Web Developer course (completed 4 out of the 6 units).

## :seedling: About Me
I had absolutly no knowledge on computer programming coming into this year. I graduated high school as the class of 2020 and was pretty confused on what I was going to do afterwards. I did not want to take a loan to go college, and I also did not want to work at a deadend job either. Fast fowarding to the middle of 2021, I was very lucky to have found out about BIT from my brother. It has literally opened an entirely new world to me, and I am enjoying every bit of it. Now I just want to keep refining my skills, and to become the best web developer I can be.
